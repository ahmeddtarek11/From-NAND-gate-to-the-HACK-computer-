<h1> Project 4: HACK Machine Language Programming </h1>


This project is part of the Nand2Tetris course, which focuses on building a computer system from the ground up, including hardware and software components. Project 4 specifically involves writing and executing programs in the Hack machine language.

<h3> What is Hack Machine Language? </h3>
The Hack machine language is the low-level programming language for the Hack computer, which is a simple, 16-bit computer designed as part of the Nand2Tetris course. The Hack computer and its language are used to illustrate the fundamentals of computer architecture and machine-level programming.

16-bit Architecture: Instructions and data are 16 bits wide.
Registers: Includes two main registers, A and D, and a set of memory locations.
Instructions: Comprises two types of instructions, A-instructions and C-instructions.
A-instructions (@value): Used to load a value into the A register.
C-instructions (dest=comp;jump): Used to perform computations and control operations.
