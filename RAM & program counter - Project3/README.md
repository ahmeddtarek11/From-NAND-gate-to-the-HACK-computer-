<h1>Project3 - RAM units and Program counter register </h1>

In this project, we build the essential memory components of a computer system, including various RAM units and the Program Counter (PC).


<h3> RAM Units: </h3>

- RAM8: Stores 8 words of 16-bit each.
- RAM64: Stores 64 words of 16-bit each.
- RAM512: Stores 512 words of 16-bit each.
- RAM4K: Stores 4096 words of 16-bit each.
- RAM16K: Stores 16384 words of 16-bit each.
  
These units are constructed hierarchically, where larger RAM units are built using smaller ones.

<h3> Program Counter (PC) </h3>

A 16-bit register that can increment, reset, or load a new value, controlling the flow of instruction execution in a computer.
